# Psychologist/therapist usecase.
This usecase is reflected in the psychologist.py python file. Due to the time constraint and lack of GPU, I opted to use a pretrained model, that is well document is a scientific paper.

## Install requirements.
To run the code `python psychologist.py` please install the following :
```
!pip install transformers
!pip install llama-index llama-index-llms-huggingface
!pip install torch
```
